## Future Scope

### AI-Powered Voice Agent (In Development)

Currently, the voice agent feature is under development. We are building an intelligent conversational AI system that will:

- **Research-Driven Conversations**: Create public voice rooms where AI agents can interact with clients based on completed research data
- **Context-Aware Discussions**: The agent will leverage research insights (company profiles, market analysis, competitor data) to have informed, personalized sales conversations
- **RAG Integration**: All voice conversations will be transcribed in real-time and stored in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
- **Continuous Learning**: Transcripts feed into the context database, allowing the LLM to learn from previous interactions and improve responses over time
- **Session History**: Users can review past conversations, extract key talking points, and track engagement metrics

**Technical Implementation:**

- LiveKit for real-time audio streaming
- Deepgram for speech-to-text transcription
- Vector database for conversation embeddings
- Cerebras LLM for context-aware response generation
- OpenAI TTS for natural voice synthesis

This feature will enable sales teams to have AI agents conduct preliminary discovery calls, answer client questions, and gather insights autonomously while maintaining conversation quality and context throughout multiple sessions.

**Development:** See `backend/README.md` and `client/README.md` for setup instructions.
